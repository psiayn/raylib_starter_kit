#+title: A simple template for creating a RayLib project in C++ 20 and CMake
#+author: Pranav Kesavarapu (psiayn)

* How to get started?
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/psiayn/raylib_starter_kit.git
cd raylib_starter_kit
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./raylib_starter_kit
#+END_SRC
If things have run successfully, you should get a simple game window.

* Developing
Just start writing your code in ~src/main.cpp~ and expand forth into the vast world of game dev

* Sources
- I used https://github.com/SasLuca/raylib-cpp-cmake-template as the inspiration for this repo ( I mean ripped it off and tweaked it to my liking. ).
- Of course https://www.raylib.com/ for tutorials / examples / docs and etc.
